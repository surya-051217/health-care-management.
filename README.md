Healthcare AI - Virtual Health Assistant is my first project on GitHub, and Iâ€™m really excited to share it! This is a web-based platform designed to help users check symptoms and book doctor appointments easily. The goal is to make healthcare more accessible and efficient using simple yet effective technology. The project is built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, providing a user-friendly and responsive interface. In the future, I plan to integrate AI-based recommendations to improve its functionality. This project not only allowed me to explore healthcare solutions but also helped me enhance my frontend development skills. Iâ€™m looking forward to adding more features and improving the overall experience. Any feedback or suggestions are welcome! ðŸš€
